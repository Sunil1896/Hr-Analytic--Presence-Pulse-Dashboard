# Presence-Pulse---Attendance-Dashboard
Presence Pulse is an interactive attendance dashboard designed to provide HR departments and management with insights into employee attendance trends, work-from-home (WFH) rates, and sick leave (SL) patterns over time. This project utilizes Power BI to visualize and analyze attendance data, aiding in effective workforce management and operational planning.

# Features
- Overall Attendance Summary: Displays key metrics including total presence percentage, WFH rate, and SL rate.
- Monthly Trends: Shows attendance, WFH, and SL percentages across different months for tracking seasonal or monthly patterns.
- Individual Employee Details: Provides a breakdown of each employee's attendance percentage, WFH percentage, and SL percentage.
- Daily Attendance Analysis: Highlights attendance, WFH, and SL rates by the day of the week to identify patterns and potential scheduling adjustments.

# Data Overview
The dashboard utilizes data from an Excel sheet containing anonymized attendance records, with fields like:

- Present % - The percentage of days an employee was present.
- WFH % - The percentage of days an employee worked from home.
- SL % - The percentage of days an employee took as sick leave.
- Date-wise Attendance - Daily attendance records with statuses such as Present (P), Work From Home (WFH), Sick Leave (SL), etc.

# Measures Created
In this project, six key measures were created to drive the analysis and provide insightful metrics:

1. Total Present %: Calculates the overall percentage of attendance across the workforce.
2. Total WFH %: Measures the percentage of work-from-home days across all employees.
3. Total SL %: Computes the overall percentage of sick leave taken.
4. Monthly Present %: Tracks the attendance percentage by month for seasonal analysis.
5. WFH by Day of the Week: Shows the WFH percentage for each day of the week to detect preferred WFH days.
6. SL by Day of the Week: Provides insights into sick leave distribution across weekdays, helping identify potential patterns.


# Insights
- Overall Presence: The average attendance rate is around 91.83%, suggesting good overall employee engagement.
- WFH Patterns: Fridays and Thursdays show the highest WFH percentages (13.01% and 11.51%, respectively), possibly indicating that employees prefer remote work towards the end of the week.
- Sick Leave Trends: Mondays show a slightly higher sick leave rate (1.62%), potentially hinting at "sick day" tendencies or genuine recovery needs after the weekend.
- Monthly Variation: Attendance rates are highest at the beginning of each quarter and tend to decrease slightly towards the end, highlighting possible fatigue or external seasonal factors.
- Employee Consistency: Certain employees maintain a consistent 100% presence rate, showcasing strong attendance commitment.
- Departmental Insights: Insights across departments can reveal if specific teams require more flexible schedules or additional support for better attendance consistency.

# Usage
- Navigate through the tabs to view attendance metrics by month, individual employees, and by day of the week.
- Filter data based on departments, dates, or individual employees for a focused view.

# Future Enhancements
- Integration with Real-Time Data: Link to live attendance databases or HR systems.
- Predictive Analysis: Implement models to predict future attendance patterns and potential leave periods.
- Employee Performance Metrics: Incorporate performance metrics to analyze attendance impact on productivity.
